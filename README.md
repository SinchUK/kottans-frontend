Hi all!
I try to write in English for practice, so I think you will be not strict for me if you find mistakes. In this course I learned new instruments for organize work on the future projects. This educational task gave me knowing about Git and GitHub and their power. With Git and GitHub we can make new parts of the project and donâ€™t care about lose our progress even if my personal computer hard drive will be lost. Because all the working data stay on the remote repository, and I can continue my work on any new machine or from any place of the world (of course if I have an internet connection:))
